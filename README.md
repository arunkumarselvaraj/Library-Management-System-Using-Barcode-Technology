# Library Management System Using Barcode Technology

This project is a university level library management system which can also be extended to manage General Library functions. Having Student, Faculty and Books data upfront, the system uses Barcode technology to maintain the records. The system also tracks and reminds students when it's about time to return the book they have loaned. It also calculates the fine if the book is returned after a certain time period. Searching for a book and it's availability features are also added.

Implemented in C++ using Object Oriented Pragramming concepts.

## What is the aim?
The aim is to build a system for Library Management that uses Barcode Technology thus reducing manual power and manual errors, making the system faster.
